# ðŸ“˜ Why Search

Search is a powerful tool that will create a better experience for your users. It will help them find the content they are looking for faster and more efficiently. It will also help them discover content they didn't know existed.

More and more, users are expecting a Google-like search experience when they come to a website. They want to be able to type in a few words and get the content they are looking for. They don't want to have to navigate through a complex hierarchy of pages to find what they are looking for.

If they can't find what they are looking for, they will leave your site and go somewhere else. This is especially true for mobile users who are often on the go and don't have time to navigate through a complex hierarchy of pages.

# Adding Search capabilities to your site

There are many ways to add search capabilities to your site. One of the most popular ways is to use an open source search engine like Elasticsearch or Solr. These search engines are very powerful and can be used to index and search millions of documents.

Behind the hood, both of these search engines use Lucene to index and search documents. Lucene is a Java library that provides a simple API for indexing and searching documents.

To use these tools, you will need to implement a syncing mechanism between your data and the search engine.
