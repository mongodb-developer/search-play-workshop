# ðŸ“˜ Full Text Search

So far, we have an application, but it's not helpful as the search capabilities are quite limited.

Now that you know about MongoDB's query language and aggregation pipelines framework, it's time to explore Atlas Search, a fully managed search service that's built on top of MongoDB's powerful aggregation framework.

## What is Atlas Search?

Atlas Search integrates with the other Atlas services to provide you with a fully managed search service. It's built on top of Lucene, the leading open-source search engine library. It's also built on top of MongoDB's aggregation framework, which means that you can use the same query language that you use to query your data to search your data.

## Benefits of Atlas Search

You've seen the limitations of querying your data using the MongoDB query language. Atlas Search provides you with several benefits:
* **Full-text search** - Atlas Search provides you with full-text search capabilities, including stemming, stop words, and synonyms.
* **Scoring** - Atlas Search provides you with a scoring system that allows you to rank your search results based on relevance.
* **Language support** - Atlas Search supports multiple languages out of the box.
* **Autocomplete** - Atlas Search provides you with autocomplete capabilities.
* **Highlighting** - Atlas Search provides you with highlighting capabilities.
