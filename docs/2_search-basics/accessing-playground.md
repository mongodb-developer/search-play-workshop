# Accessing the Atlas Search Playground

Let's start by accessing the Atlas Search Playground and setting up our environment.

## Steps to Access the Playground

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [https://search-playground.mongodb.com/](https://search-playground.mongodb.com/).
2. You'll be presented with the Atlas Search Playground interface.

## Choosing a Template

For this workshop, we'll use a pre-configured template:

1. In the navigation on the left, click "Select Template".
2. Choose the "catalog" dataset from the list of pre-configured environments.
3. Click "Select".

## Understanding the Playground Interface

The playground is divided into several key areas:

1. **Query Panel**: Where you'll write your search queries.
2. **Results Panel**: Displays the results of your query.
3. **Index Panel**: Shows the current index configuration.
4. **Data Source Panel**: Displays sample documents from the dataset.

In the next section, we'll start writing our first search query!
